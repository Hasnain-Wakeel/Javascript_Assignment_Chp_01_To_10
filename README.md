# Javascript_Assignment_Chp_01_To_10
“JavaScript assignment (Chapters : 1–10) with examples of alerts, variables, prompts, math operations, conditional statements, and comparison operators.”

📘 JavaScript Assignment (Chapters 1 to 10) :

This repository contains my JavaScript practice assignment from Chapter 1 to Chapter 10.
The goal of this assignment is to build a strong foundation in JavaScript by practicing its core concepts step by step.

📑 Topics Covered and Descriptions :

🔹 1. Alert

The alert() function is used to display a popup message to the user in the browser.
It is often used for showing notifications or messages.

Example:

alert("Welcome to JavaScript!");

🔹 2. Variables for Strings

Variables are used to store data.
When storing text data, we call it a string variable (text is always inside quotes " ").

Example:

let name = "Ali";
alert("My name is " + name);

🔹 3. Variables for Numbers

We can also store numbers inside variables to perform calculations or display them.

Example:

let age = 20;
let year = 2025;
console.log("Age:", age);
console.log("Year:", year);

🔹 4. Prompts

The prompt() function is used to take input from the user.
It shows a dialog box where the user can type something.

Example:

let userName = prompt("Enter your name:");
alert("Hello " + userName + "!");

🔹 5. Math Operations

JavaScript allows us to perform basic mathematical operations like:

Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)
Modulus (%) → remainder after division

Example:

let a = 10;
let b = 3;

console.log("Addition:", a + b);        // 13
console.log("Subtraction:", a - b);     // 7
console.log("Multiplication:", a * b);  // 30
console.log("Division:", a / b);        // 3.33
console.log("Modulus:", a % b);         // 1

🔹 6. Conditional Statements

Conditional statements (if, else if, else) allow us to make decisions in code.

Example:

let marks = 75;

if (marks >= 80) {
    console.log("Excellent");
} else if (marks >= 50) {
    console.log("You Passed");
} else {
    console.log("You Failed");
}

🔹 7. Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare values.

== → equal (after type conversion)
=== → equal (strict, without type conversion)
!= → not equal
!== → strict not equal
> → greater than
< → less than
>= → greater or equal
<= → less or equal

Example:

console.log(5 == "5");   // true
console.log(5 === "5");  // false
console.log(10 > 5);     // true
console.log(10 <= 5);    // false

📖 Summary

In this assignment, I have learned and practiced the fundamental concepts of JavaScript:

1.Displaying messages with alerts
2.Creating and using variables (strings and numbers).
3.Taking user input with prompts.
4.Performing basic math operations.
5.Writing conditional statements for decision making.
6.Using comparison operators to compare values.

These are the building blocks of JavaScript and will help me in learning advanced programming concepts in the future.
